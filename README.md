# Veronica-Robot

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In this module, you have learned about the following in Kotlin:

1. Variables and Operators
2. Functions
3. Arrays, Lists, and Strings
4. Conditionals and Loops
5. Exception Handling
6. Classes, Objects, and Interfaces

Every day in the morning we need to complete some set of predefined tasks that remain
constant. We can list the generic tasks as below:

1. Ring the alarm on time
2. Make coffee
3. Heat the water to a suitable temperature
4. Pack your bag (Keep only appropriate books for the day)
5. Cook breakfast and lunch
6. Iron the clothes
From now on a Kotlin Robot will complete the above set of tasks for us.

SPECIFICATIONS: 

About the Robot:

Consider the Robot as your personal assistant. You will give the Robot a name by which you will
call it. You also need to define the functions performed by the Robot. These functions will be
the same as above i.e. the tasks which it will perform for you in the morning. Feel free to
add/modify the above-listed tasks as per your choice.

Ring the alarm:

The Robot will ring the alarm every day at a specified time which will be set by you. You also
need to set the days on which the alarm will not ring.

Make coffee:

The Robot will make coffee for you every day. You need to tell the Robot about the following
details:

1. How do you like your coffee (Black/With Milk).
2. How much sugar you’ll take.

You can also customize the preferences according to the day of the week.

Heat the water:

You need to tell the Robot about the temperature you like for your bathing water. Additional
information which can be added is whether you’ll be bathing on a particular day or not.
Although, we recommend that you take baths every day ;).

Pack your bag:

The Robot will keep the books in your bag as per your timetable. You need to input the
timetable into your Robot’s memory so that it works accordingly.

Cook breakfast and lunch:

The Robot will cook your food according to your taste. You can let the Robot know which food
items do you like for breakfast and lunch and it will choose randomly from the list provided by
you. Here is a tip for you. To randomly choose an option from a list you can use the .random()
method on the list.

Iron the clothes:

Just tell the Robot what you want to wear before taking the bath and the clothes will be ready
for you as soon as you come out after bathing.
